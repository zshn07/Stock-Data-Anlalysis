# Stock-Data-Anlalysis
My first python script for basic stock data analysis.
It downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library and analyzes stock performance over time.

Features:
- Download historical stock data for a chosen ticker (e.g., AAPL)
- Calculate daily returns, 20-day moving average, and cumulative returns
- Plot closing price with moving average, daily return distribution, and cumulative returns over time
- Print summary statistics such as average return, volatility, max/min returns, and total trading days

Libraries Used:
- yfinance
- pandas
- matplotlib

How to Run
Install dependencies if needed:

pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib

Run the script:
python stock_analysis.py
